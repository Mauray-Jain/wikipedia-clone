						</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture" title="Computer architecture">Computer architecture</a> has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_languages"  title="Imperative languages">imperative languages</a>—which implement operations in a specified order) developed to perform well on the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture" title="Von Neumann architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>. While early programming languages were closely tied to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware" title="Computer hardware">hardware</a>, over time they have developed more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)" title="Abstraction (computer science)">abstraction</a> to hide implementation details for greater simplicity.

Many aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs—for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling" title="Exception handling">exception handling</a> simplifies error handling, but at a performance cost. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory" title="Programming language theory">Programming language theory</a> is the subfield of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" title="Computer science">computer science</a> that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

						<p>Programming languages differ from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">natural languages</a> in that natural languages are used for interaction between people, while programming languages are designed to allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.
						</p><p>The term <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language" title="Computer language">computer language</a></i> is sometimes used interchangeably with "programming language". However, usage of these terms varies among authors.
						</p><p>In one usage, programming languages are described as a subset of computer languages. Similarly, the term "computer language" may be used in contrast to the term "programming language" to describe languages used in computing but not considered programming languages – for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language" title="Markup language">markup languages</a>. Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness" title="Turing completeness">Turing complete</a> languages. Most practical programming languages are Turing complete, and as such are equivalent in what programs they can compute.
						</p><p>Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_machine" title="Abstract machine">abstract machines</a> and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Reynolds" title="John C. Reynolds">John C. Reynolds</a> emphasizes that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_specification" title="Formal specification">formal specification</a> languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.

						<div class=" 3"><h3 id="Early_developments">Early developments</h3></div>
						<p>The first programmable computers were invented at the end of the 1940s, and with them, the first programming languages. The earliest computers were programmed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_programming_language" title="First-generation programming language">first-generation programming languages</a> (1GLs), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_language"  title="Machine language">machine language</a> (simple instructions that could be directly executed by the processor). This code was very difficult to debug and was not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portability_(computing)"  title="Portability (computing)">portable</a> between different computer systems. In order to improve the ease of programming, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_languages"  title="Assembly languages">assembly languages</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-generation_programming_language" title="Second-generation programming language">second-generation programming languages</a>—2GLs) were invented, diverging from the machine language to make programs easier to understand for humans, although they did not increase portability.
						</p><p>Initially, hardware resources were scarce and expensive, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources" title="Human resources">human resources</a> were cheaper. Therefore, cumbersome languages that were time-consuming to use, but were closer to the hardware for higher efficiency were favored. The introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language" title="High-level programming language">high-level programming languages</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-generation_programming_language" title="Third-generation programming language">third-generation programming languages</a>—3GLs)—revolutionized programming. These languages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computing)"  title="Abstraction (computing)">abstracted</a> away the details of the hardware, instead being designed to express algorithms that could be understood more easily by humans. For example, arithmetic expressions could now be written in symbolic notation and later translated into machine code that the hardware could execute. In 1957, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a> (FORmula TRANslation) was invented. Often considered the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiled</a> high-level programming language, Fortran has remained in use into the twenty-first century.

						<p>Around 1960, the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframes"  title="Mainframes">mainframes</a>—general purpose computers—were developed, although they could only be operated by professionals and the cost was extreme. The data and instructions were input by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_cards"  title="Punch cards">punch cards</a>, meaning that no input could be added while the program was running. The languages developed at this time therefore are designed for minimal interaction. After the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor" title="Microprocessor">microprocessor</a>, computers in the 1970s became dramatically cheaper. New computers also allowed more user interaction, which was supported by newer programming languages.
						</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp (programming language)">Lisp</a>, implemented in 1958, was the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional programming">functional programming</a> language. Unlike Fortran, it supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" title="Recursion">recursion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expression"  title="Conditional expression">conditional expressions</a>, and it also introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_management"  title="Dynamic memory management">dynamic memory management</a> on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(computer_science)"  title="Heap (computer science)">heap</a> and automatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)" title="Garbage collection (computer science)">garbage collection</a>. For the next decades, Lisp dominated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> applications. In 1978, another functional language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)" title="ML (programming language)">ML</a>, introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference" title="Type inference">inferred types</a> and polymorphic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)" title="Parameter (computer programming)">parameters</a>.
						</p><p>After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> (ALGOrithmic Language) was released in 1958 and 1960, it became the standard in computing literature for describing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a>. Although its commercial success was limited, most popular imperative languages—including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" title="Pascal (programming language)">Pascal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)" title="Ada (programming language)">Ada</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="C++">C++</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" title="C Sharp (programming language)">C#</a>—are directly or indirectly descended from ALGOL 60. Among its innovations adopted by later programming languages included greater portability and the first use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar" title="Context-free grammar">context-free</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form" title="Backus–Naur form">BNF</a> grammar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula" title="Simula">Simula</a>, the first language to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-oriented programming">object-oriented programming</a> (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtypes"  title="Subtypes">subtypes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch" title="Dynamic dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(computer_science)"  title="Inheritance (computer science)">inheritance</a>), also descends from ALGOL and achieved commercial success. C, another ALGOL descendant, has sustained popularity into the twenty-first century. C allows access to lower-level machine operations more than other contemporary languages. Its power and efficiency, generated in part with flexible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)" title="Pointer (computer programming)">pointer</a> operations, comes at the cost of making it more difficult to write correct code.
						</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" title="Prolog">Prolog</a>, designed in 1972, was the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming" title="Logic programming">logic programming</a> language, communicating with a computer using formal logic notation.

						<p>During the 1980s, the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a> transformed the roles for which programming languages were used. New languages introduced in the 1980s included C++, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superset"  title="Superset">superset</a> of C that can compile C programs but also supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" title="Class (computer programming)">classes</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)" title="Inheritance (object-oriented programming)">inheritance</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)" title="Ada (programming language)">Ada</a> and other new languages introduced support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)" title="Concurrency (computer science)">concurrency</a>. The Japanese government invested heavily into the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_programming_language" title="Fifth-generation programming language">fifth-generation languages</a> that added support for concurrency to logic programming constructs, but these languages were outperformed by other concurrency-supporting languages.
						</p><p>Due to the rapid growth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> in the 1990s, new programming languages were introduced to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_pages"  title="Web pages">Web pages</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network" title="Computer network">networking</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a>, based on C++ and designed for increased portability across systems and security, enjoyed large-scale success because these features are essential for many Internet applications.

						<div class=" 3"><h3 id="2000s_to_present">2000s to present</h3></div>
						<p>During the 2000s, there was a slowdown in the development of new programming languages that achieved widespread popularity. One innovation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_programming" title="Service-oriented programming">service-oriented programming</a>, designed to exploit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_systems"  title="Distributed systems">distributed systems</a> whose components are connected by a network. Services are similar to objects in object-oriented programming, but run on a separate process. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" title="C Sharp (programming language)">C#</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)" title="F Sharp (programming language)">F#</a> cross-pollinated ideas between imperative and functional programming. After 2010, several new languages—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)" title="Rust (programming language)">Rust</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)" title="Go (programming language)">Go</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)" title="Swift (programming language)">Swift</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_(programming_language)" title="Zig (programming language)">Zig</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_(programming_language)" title="Carbon (programming language)">Carbon</a> —competed for the performance-critical software for which C had historically been used. Most of the new programming languages uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">static typing</a> while a few numbers of new languages use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">dynamic typing</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(programming_language)" title="Ring (programming language)">Ring</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)" title="Julia (programming language)">Julia</a>.

The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages"  title="Formal semantics of programming languages">formal</a> or hard-coded in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation_(computing)"  title="Reference implementation (computing)">reference implementation</a>). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.
						</p><p>The programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" title="Regular expression">regular expressions</a> (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis" title="Lexical analysis">lexical</a> structure) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form" title="Backus–Naur form">Backus–Naur form</a> (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar" title="Context-free grammar">grammatical</a> structure).
						</p>
						</p><p>Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior" title="Undefined behavior">undefined behavior</a>. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.
						</p><p>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">natural language</a> as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:
						</p>
						<ul><li>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously" title="Colorless green ideas sleep furiously">Colorless green ideas sleep furiously</a>." is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.</li>
							<li>"John is a married bachelor." is grammatically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formedness" title="Well-formedness">well-formed</a> but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.</li></ul>
						<p>The following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C language</a> fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation <code>*p &gt;&gt; 4</code> has no meaning for a value having a complex type and <code>p-&gt;im</code> is not defined because the value of <code>p</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer" title="Null pointer">null pointer</a>):
						</p>
						<p>If the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_declaration"  title="Type declaration">type declaration</a> on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on the undefined variable <code>p</code> during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.
						</p><p>The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy" title="Chomsky hierarchy">Chomsky hierarchy</a>. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar" title="Context-free grammar">context-free grammars</a>. Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem" title="Undecidable problem">undecidable problem</a>, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution. In contrast to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_macro"  title="Lisp macro">Lisp's macro system</a> and Perl's <code>BEGIN</code> blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.

						<div class=" 4"><h4 id="Static_semantics">Static semantics</h4></div>
						<p>Static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms. For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier" title="Identifier">identifier</a> is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_statement"  title="Case statement">case statement</a> are distinct. Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine"  title="Subroutine">subroutine</a> calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a> called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">type system</a>. Other forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis"  title="Static code analysis">static analyses</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_analysis"  title="Data flow analysis">data flow analysis</a> may also be part of static semantics. Programming languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" title="Java (programming language)">Java</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" title="C Sharp (programming language)">C#</a> have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_assignment_analysis" title="Definite assignment analysis">definite assignment analysis</a>, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their respective static semantics.

						<p>Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy" title="Evaluation strategy">strategy</a> by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow" title="Control flow">control structures</a> conditionally execute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)" title="Statement (computer science)">statements</a>. The <i>dynamic semantics</i> (also known as <i>execution semantics</i>) of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research goes into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages"  title="Formal semantics of programming languages">formal semantics of programming languages</a>, which allows execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.

						<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type" title="Data type">data type</a> is a set of allowable values and operations that can be performed on these values. Each programming language's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">type system</a> defines which data types exist, the type of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)" title="Expression (mathematics)">expression</a>, and how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_equivalence"  title="Type equivalence">type equivalence</a> and  function in the language.
						</p><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory" title="Type theory">type theory</a>, a language is fully typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable. In contrast, an untyped language, such as most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly languages</a>, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths. In practice, while few languages are fully typed, most offer a degree of typing. 
						</p><p>Because different types (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer" title="Integer">integers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point"  title="Floating point">floats</a>) represent values differently, unexpected results will occur if one type is used when another is expected. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_checking"  title="Type checking">Type checking</a> will flag this error, usually at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time" title="Compile time">compile time</a> (runtime type checking is more costly).

						<p>Early programming languages often supported only built-in, numeric types such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer" title="Integer">integer</a> (signed and unsigned) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point"  title="Floating point">floating point</a> (to support operations on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number" title="Real number">real numbers</a> that are not integers). Most programming languages support multiple sizes of floats (often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format" title="Single-precision floating-point format">float</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format" title="Double-precision floating-point format">double</a>) and integers depending on the size and precision required by the programmer. Storing an integer in a type that is too small to represent it leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow" title="Integer overflow">integer overflow</a>. The most common way of representing negative numbers with signed types is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twos_complement"  title="Twos complement">twos complement</a>, although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones_complement"  title="Ones complement">ones complement</a> is also used.  Other common types include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type" title="Boolean data type">Boolean</a>—which is either true or false—and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)" title="Character (computing)">character</a>—traditionally one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte" title="Byte">byte</a>, sufficient to represent all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" title="ASCII">ASCII</a> characters. 
						</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_type)" title="Array (data type)">Arrays</a> are a data type whose elements, in many languages, must consist of a single type of fixed length. Other languages define arrays as references to data stored elsewhere and support elements of varying types.

						<div class=" 4"><h4 id="Static_and_dynamic_typing">Static and dynamic typing</h4></div>
						<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_typing"  title="Static typing">static typing</a>, all expressions have their types determined before a program executes, typically at compile-time. Most widely used, statically typed programming languages require the types of variables to be specified explicitly. In some languages, types are implicit; one form of this is when the compiler can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference" title="Type inference">infer</a> types based on context. The downside of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_typing"  title="Implicit typing">implicit typing</a> is the potential for errors to go undetected. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with functional languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell" title="Haskell">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)" title="ML (programming language)">ML</a>. 
						</p><p>With dynamic typing, the type is not attached to the variable but only the value encoded in it. A single variable can be reused for a value of a different type. Although this provides more flexibility to the programmer, it is at the cost of lower reliability and less ability for the programming language to check for errors. Some languages allow variables of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_type" title="Union type">union type</a> to which any type of value can be assigned, in an exception to their usual static typing rules.

						<p>In computing, multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously. Many programming languages support instruction-level and subprogram-level concurrency. By the twenty-first century, additional processing power on computers was increasingly coming from the use of additional processors, which requires programmers to design software that makes use of multiple processors simultaneously to achieve improved performance. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language"  title="Interpreted language">Interpreted languages</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" title="Python (programming language)">Python</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" title="Ruby (programming language)">Ruby</a> do not support the concurrent use of multiple processors. Other programming languages do support managing data shared between different threads by controlling the order of execution of key instructions via the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)" title="Semaphore (programming)">semaphores</a>, controlling access to shared data via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)" title="Monitor (synchronization)">monitor</a>, or enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing" title="Message passing">message passing</a> between threads.

						<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling" title="Exception handling">Exception handling</a></div>
						<p>Many programming languages include exception handlers, a section of code triggered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error"  title="Runtime error">runtime errors</a> that can deal with them in two main ways:
						</p>
						<ul><li>Termination: shutting down and handing over control to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a>. This option is considered the simplest.</li>
							<li>Resumption: resuming the program near where the exception occurred. This can trigger a repeat of the exception, unless the exception handler is able to modify values to prevent the exception from reoccurring.</li></ul>
						<p>Some programming languages support dedicating a block of code to run regardless of whether an exception occurs before the code is reached; this is called finalization.
						</p><p>There is a tradeoff between increased ability to handle exceptions and reduced performance. For example, even though array index errors are common C does not check them for performance reasons. Although programmers can write code to catch user-defined exceptions, this can clutter a program. Standard libraries in some languages, such as C, use their return values to indicate an exception. Some languages and their compilers have the option of turning on and off error handling capability, either temporarily or permanently.

						<p>One of the most important influences on programming language design has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture" title="Computer architecture">computer architecture</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_languages"  title="Imperative languages">Imperative languages</a>, the most commonly used type, were designed to perform well on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture" title="Von Neumann architecture">von Neumann architecture</a>, the most common computer architecture. In von Neumann architecture, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory" title="Computer memory">memory</a> stores both data and instructions, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU"  title="CPU">CPU</a> that performs instructions on data is separate, and data must be piped back and forth to the CPU. The central elements in these languages are variables, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assignment</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration" title="Iteration">iteration</a>, which is more efficient than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)" title="Recursion (computer science)">recursion</a> on these machines.  
						</p><p>Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. The birth of programming languages in the 1950s was stimulated by the desire to make a universal programming language suitable for all machines and uses, avoiding the need to write code for different computers. By the early 1960s, the idea of a universal language was rejected due to the differing requirements of the variety of purposes for which code was written. 
						</p>
						<div class=" 3"><h3 id="Tradeoffs">Tradeoffs</h3></div>
						<p>Desirable qualities of programming languages include readability, writability, and reliability. These features can reduce the cost of training programmers in a language, the amount of time needed to write and maintain programs in the language, the cost of compiling the code, and increase runtime performance. 
						</p>
						<ul><li>Although early programming languages often prioritized efficiency over readability, the latter has grown in importance since the 1970s. Having multiple operations to achieve the same result can be detrimental to readability, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overload"  title="Operator overload">overloading operators</a>, so that the same operator can have multiple meanings. Another feature important to readability is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality" title="Orthogonality">orthogonality</a>, limiting the number of constructs that a programmer has to learn. A syntax structure that is easily understood and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_word" title="Reserved word">special words</a> that are immediately obvious also supports readability.</li>
							<li>Writability is the ease of use for writing code to solve the desired problem. Along with the same features essential for readability, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)" title="Abstraction (computer science)">abstraction</a>—interfaces that enable hiding details from the client—and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_power_(computer_science)" title="Expressive power (computer science)">expressivity</a>—enabling more concise programs—additionally help the programmer write code. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer, but over time support for abstraction has increased, allowing programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. Most programming languages come with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library" title="Standard library">standard library</a> of commonly used functions.</li>
							<li>Reliability means that a program performs as specified in a wide range of circumstances. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_checking"  title="Type checking">Type checking</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling" title="Exception handling">exception handling</a>, and restricted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing_(computing)" title="Aliasing (computing)">aliasing</a> (multiple variable names accessing the same region of memory) all can improve a program's reliability.</li></ul>
						<p>Programming language design often involves tradeoffs. For example, features to improve reliability typically come at the cost of performance. Increased expressivity due to a large number of operators makes writing code easier but comes at the cost of readability.
						</p><p><span class="anchor" id="English-like_programming_languages"></span>
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_programming" title="Natural-language programming">Natural-language programming</a> has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra" title="Edsger W. Dijkstra">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a> took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis" title="Alan Perlis">Alan Perlis</a> was similarly dismissive of the idea.

						</p><p>A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following:
						</p>
						<ul><li>An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language" title="Natural language">natural language</a> (e.g., as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C language</a>), or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages"  title="Formal semantics of programming languages">formal semantics</a> (e.g., as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML" title="Standard ML">Standard ML</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)" title="Scheme (programming language)">Scheme</a> specifications).</li>
							<li>A description of the behavior of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">translator</a> for the language (e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="C++">C++</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a> specifications).

						<p>An implementation of a programming language is the conversion of a program into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code" title="Machine code">machine code</a> that can be executed by the hardware. The machine code then can be executed with the help of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" title="Operating system">operating system</a>. The most common form of interpretation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle" title="Software release life cycle">production code</a> is by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a>, which translates the source code via an intermediate-level language into machine code, known as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable" title="Executable">executable</a>. Once the program is compiled, it will run more quickly than with other implementation methods. Some compilers are able to provide further <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization"  title="Optimization">optimization</a> to reduce memory or computation usage when the executable runs, but increasing compilation time.
						</p><p>Another implementation method is to run the program with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)" title="Interpreter (computing)">interpreter</a>, which translates each line of software into machine code just before it executes. Although it can make debugging easier, the downside of interpretation is that it runs 10 to 100 times slower than a compiled executable. Hybrid interpretation methods provide some of the benefits of compilation and some of the benefits of interpretation via partial compilation. One form this takes is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation" title="Just-in-time compilation">just-in-time compilation</a>, in which the software is compiled ahead of time into an intermediate language, and then into machine code immediately before execution.

						<div class=" 2"><h2 id="Proprietary_languages">Proprietary languages</h2></div>
						<p>Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" title="Domain-specific language">domain-specific languages</a> or internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" title="Scripting language">scripting languages</a> for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.
						</p><p>Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a> asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming_language"  title="Java programming language">Java programming language</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" title="C Sharp (programming language)">C#</a> programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime" title="Common Language Runtime">Common Language Runtime</a> (CLR) as a closed environment.
						</p><p>Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB" title="MATLAB">MATLAB</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript" title="VBScript">VBScript</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Language" title="Wolfram Language">Wolfram Language</a>. Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)" title="Erlang (programming language)">Erlang</a> was originally Ericsson's internal programming language.
						</p><p>Open source programming languages are particularly helpful for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science" title="Open science">open science</a> applications, enhancing the capacity for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis" title="Replication crisis">replication</a> and code sharing.

						<div class=" 2"><h2 id="Use">Use</h2></div>
						<p>Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.
							Individual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.
						</p><p>Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode" title="Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.
						</p><p>A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer" title="Programmer">programmer</a> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science)" title="Abstraction (computer science)">abstractions</a> present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_primitive" title="Language primitive">primitives</a>). <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Programming"  title="Computer Programming">Programming</a></i> is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.
						</p><p>Programs for a computer might be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)" title="Execution (computing)">executed</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing" title="Batch processing">batch process</a> without human interaction, or a user might type <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)" title="Command (computing)">commands</a> in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)" title="Session (computer science)">interactive session</a> of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)" title="Interpreter (computing)">interpreter</a>. In this case the "commands" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell" title="Unix shell">Unix shell</a> or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" title="Command-line interface">command-line interface</a>), without compiling, it is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" title="Scripting language">scripting language</a>.
						</p>
						<div class=" 3"><h3 id="Measuring_language_usage">Measuring language usage</h3></div>
						<p>Determining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" title="COBOL">COBOL</a> is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer" title="Mainframe computer">mainframes</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran" title="Fortran">Fortran</a> in scientific and engineering applications; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)" title="Ada (programming language)">Ada</a> in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time, and embedded applications; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C</a> in embedded applications and operating systems. Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.
						</p><p>Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed:
						</p>
						<ul><li>counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language</li>
							<li>the number of books sold that teach or describe the language</li>
							<li>estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language&nbsp;–  which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches</li>
							<li>counts of language references (i.e., to the name of the language) found using a web search engine.</li></ul>

						<p>A <b>dialect</b> of a programming language or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_exchange_language"  title="Data exchange language">data exchange language</a> is a (relatively small) variation or extension of the language that does not change its intrinsic nature. With languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)" title="Scheme (programming language)">Scheme</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" title="Forth (programming language)">Forth</a>, standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate, or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect" title="Dialect">dialect</a>. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language" title="Domain-specific language">domain-specific language</a>, often a subset. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp (programming language)">Lisp</a> world, most languages that use basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression" title="S-expression">S-expression</a> syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly as do, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)" title="Racket (programming language)">Racket</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure" title="Clojure">Clojure</a>.

							<li>Functional programming languages work by successively applying functions to the given parameters. Although appreciated by many researchers for their simplicity and elegance, problems with efficiency have prevented them from being widely adopted.</li>
							<li>Logic languages are designed so that the software, rather than the programmer, decides what order in which the instructions are executed.</li>
							<li>Object-oriented programming—whose characteristic features are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_abstraction"  title="Data abstraction">data abstraction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)" title="Inheritance (object-oriented programming)">inheritance</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch" title="Dynamic dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a>—is supported by most popular imperative languages and some functional languages.</li></ul>
						<p>Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_languages"  title="Markup languages">markup languages</a> are not programming languages, some have extensions that support limited programming.
