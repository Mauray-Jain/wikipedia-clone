            <a href="#">Justus</a> was the fourth
            <a href="#">archbishop of Canterbury</a>.
            <a href="#"> Pope Gregory the Great</a> sent Justus to England on a
            mission to <a href="#">Christianise the Anglo-Saxons</a>, probably
            arriving with the second group of missionaries despatched in 601.
            Justus became the first <a href="#"> bishop of Rochester</a> in 604
            and signed a letter to the Irish bishops urging them to adopt the
            Roman method of calculating the <a href="#">date of Easter</a>. He
            also attended a church council in Paris in 614. Following the death
            of <a href="#"> King Æthelberht</a> of Kent in 616, Justus was
            forced to flee to Gaul but was reinstated in his diocese the
            following year. In 624, Justus became Archbishop of Canterbury,
            overseeing the despatch of missionaries to
            <a href="#">Northumbria</a>. He died on 10 November, probably
            sometime between 627 and 631. After his death, he was revered as a
            saint and had a shrine in <a href="#">St Augustine's Abbey</a> in
            <a href="#"> Canterbury</a>, to which his remains were translated in
            the 1090s (gravestone pictured). (<a href="#">This article</a> is
